Hi, I am Hamza Reza Pavel, a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. I completed my B.S. from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. Before starting my Ph.D., I have worked at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com) and [Chaldal](https://chaldal.com) as a software engineer. I have over three years of experience working as a software engineer. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Heracleia Human Centered Computing Lab](http://heracleia.uta.edu) under the supervision of Professor [Fillia Makedon](http://heracleia.uta.edu/~makedon/). My research interest includes Human-robot Interaction, Human-computer Interaction, Computer Vision, and applied Machine Learning. My research focuses on detecting cognitive fatigue using Machine Learning from multiple data modalities. Apart from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have research experience in Graph Theory, specifically developing algorithms to detect centrality measures in Homogenous Multi-layer Networks.

Outside of research, I like sci-fi and fantasy novels and RPG games. Feel free to connect with me. I'm always eager to engage in meaningful conversations and collaborations.
